One-file python program to hide text into another, using a steganography method based on special characters

This program could be used in the case you want to hide a secret message into another one that looks like a banal message.
As it is based on special characters, the final text result can to not be shown correctly on some operating systems such as IOS or some others. So be carefull when sharing the text.
Make sure the terminal you are using shows these special characters like spaces, so you can copy it. These spaces wont be shown after pasting the text on common android apps like whatsapp, snapchat, telegram,...
You can choose a key to encrypt the hidden text, to be sure that someone wont be able to understand it, even if he finds it.

Tested on Termux

Enjoy !
